# 🧠 CiviLens Backend
### Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Syrian Societal Events

> **Inspired by:** [*XGraphRAG: Interactive Visual Analysis for Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation* (Ke Wang et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06645)

---

## 🌍 Overview

**CiviLens** is a research-oriented project that explores **Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG)** applied to **Syrian societal events**.  
It leverages structured event data (similar to the Arabic ACLED dataset) and modern retrieval-generation techniques to answer complex, contextual questions about social and civic dynamics.

While traditional RAG systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieved textual data, CiviLens follows the **GraphRAG approach** from *XGraphRAG*, introducing a **knowledge graph** as an intermediate layer that captures relationships between events, actors, regions, and topics.

This graph structure helps:
- Improve contextual retrieval (via graph proximity and relationships)
- Enhance interpretability of retrieved information
- Provide structured, explainable answers about societal patterns

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🧩 Build a **graph-augmented RAG pipeline** that integrates structured and unstructured data.
- 🧠 Support **context-aware QA** and analysis for event-based datasets.
- 📊 Explore the **interpretability and reasoning trace** of GraphRAG in a real-world domain.
- 🌐 Focus on **Syrian societal events**, using data similar to Arabic ACLED.

**Main Components**
1. **Data Ingestion Layer** – Cleans and normalizes event data, builds the graph structure.  
2. **Retriever Layer** – Retrieves relevant nodes and edges using semantic + graph similarity.  
3. **Generator Layer** – Uses an LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash) to produce contextual summaries.  
4. **Storage** – SQL Server for structured data, Qdrant for vectors, Neo4j for graph structure.  
5. **Frontend** – Simple React + OpenUI interface for query and visualization.

## 🧪 Example Query

> “What were the major societal tensions in northern Syria during 2024?”

**CiviLens**:

* Retrieves related event clusters (conflicts, protests, civic actions)
* Expands context using graph relationships
* Generates a concise analytical answer with sources

---

## 🧠 Research Context

This project **does not reproduce** the full visualization framework from *XGraphRAG*,
but **adopts its conceptual methodology** — using a **graph-based retrieval layer** to enhance interpretability and contextual relevance in LLM-based QA systems.
